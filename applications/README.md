# Applications

This folder contains the application services for the project. These services are essential for the functionality and management of the application.

## Structure

The structure of the application is organized such that each service is placed in its own folder. This helps in maintaining a clean and manageable codebase.

1. Create a new folder for each service within the `applications` directory.
2. Name the folder according to the service it contains.
3. Place all related files for the service within its respective folder.

## Example

```
applications/
├── academic/
├── chat/
└── ...
```
